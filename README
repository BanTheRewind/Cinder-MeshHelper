Cinder-MeshHelper is a library of static functions to aide
in the creation of primitive or custom TriMesh or VboMesh 
meshes in Cinder.

This project is currently in beta and undergoing testing. 
"VboMeshSample" is more complete / functional than its 
TriMesh counterpart.

XCode projects / lib coming as soon as the sample apps 
are dialed in Visual Studio.
